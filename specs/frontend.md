# Frontend

Purpose: app shell, page map, screen designs, visual direction, status pills, i18n, and the house style rules.

## Process rules

- Design before build. Every screen's design is proposed and approved by the user before it is implemented.
- Frontend stack: React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS v4, Radix UI Primitives, Lucide React, TanStack Query v5, Recharts.
- Layout proportions not yet decided (for example any 60/40 split) must be confirmed with the user before the frontend is built.

## House style and precedence

- House style is shared with the Astraya project. It is not a copy of Astraya. Astraya is inspiration and a starting point.
- Improve on Astraya where that serves HarborGate users better, and document each intentional difference and its reason in this file.
- Adapt, do not transfer. Astraya's domain-specific UI decisions (astrology charts, persons, element and aspect colours, tone names, chart pages) are not carried over. Keep the underlying principle and re-decide the concrete choice for HarborGate: CVE findings, Harbor repositories, GitHub targets, sync jobs, admin and audit views.
- Astraya concrete values (colours, shell items, page names) may be reused only where they fit HarborGate's domain, and each reuse is justified here.
- Precedence: where Astraya's UI style conflicts with this spec, this spec wins. If a conflict cannot be resolved that way, ask the user which takes precedence before building that part.

## App shell (decided)

- Collapsible left rail. Adapted from Astraya's documented target shell.
- Top rail items, in order: Dashboard, Mappings, CVEs, Sync jobs.
- Bottom rail items: Admin (admins only), Account.
- Content header holds the page title and the primary action.
- Sticky header with environment status badges.
- Content width capped at 64rem.
- On narrow screens the rail becomes a drawer.
- Reason for the adaptation: HarborGate's core objects are mappings, CVE findings, and sync jobs, and Admin is role-gated.

## Page map (decided)

- Dashboard: summary and recent syncs.
- Mappings: create, edit, and show the webhook URL.
- CVEs: list, and a per-CVE view.
- Sync jobs: sync history and failures. Replaces a separate Logs page.
- Admin (admins only): four tabs, see below.
- Account: profile, credentials, theme, language. Replaces a separate Settings page.
- Login: outside the shell, shown before authentication.
- Scope: all pages above are in the first release.

## Dashboard (decided)

- Summary counts: open CVEs by severity (CRITICAL, HIGH), fixed CVEs, open GitHub issues, failed syncs.
- Below the counts: recent syncs with status and time. Failed rows have a retry action.

## Mapping form (decided)

- One page. Stacked, grouped sections in this order:
  - Harbor source: Harbor project, Harbor repository, credential.
  - GitHub target: GitHub owner, GitHub repository, default branch.
  - Issues: auto-create issues on or off, minimum severity.
- Actions: Cancel and Save mapping.
- Duplicate target: shows an inline error under the GitHub repository field: "Already used by mapping <name>. Choose another repository or branch." Save is blocked until the target changes.
- The app never moves a target from one mapping to another.

## Settings rows (decided)

- Stacked layout: label, then optional help text, then the control, in one column.
- Do not use the Astraya 60/40 two-column grid for HarborGate forms.
- Multi-field forms (mappings, credentials) use the same stacked pattern.

## Per-CVE view (decided)

- A detail page for one CVE, linkable by URL.
- Header: CVE id, severity pill, status pill, package, first seen date, link to the GitHub issue, and an "Accept risk" action.
- Below the header: a table with one row per tracked tag (up to 10). Columns: tag, status, last scan date, fixed-in version when known.

## Admin (decided)

- One Admin entry in the rail, shown to admins only.
- Four tabs:
  - Jobs: housekeeping and sync jobs, with counts and errors. Includes cleanup and retention runs and polling runs.
  - Failed syncs: error message and a retry action.
  - Audit log: admin actions such as user create and delete, role changes, OIDC config changes, credential rotation.
  - Health: Harbor and GitHub reachability, token expiry, missing scopes, robot account expiry date with a warning before it lapses.

## Visual direction (decided)

- House style, dark-first. Dark is the default theme. Light is a full peer theme, with every token defined.
- Dark: background `#0b0c18`, surface `#15162a`, text `#eceafa`, accent `#a390fb`.
- Light: background `#fbfaff`, surface `#f3f1fa`, text `#16152b`, accent `#5b3fd4`.
- Focus: a visible 2px ring in the accent colour.
- Status colours come from the list below, not from Astraya's element or aspect colours.

## Status colours

- Critical: `#ef4444`
- High: `#f97316`
- Medium: `#eab308`
- Low: `#3b82f6`
- Success: `#10b981`

## Status pills (decided)

- Tables show every severity and status as a coloured pill with a text label, for example CRITICAL, HIGH, OPEN, FIXED.
- Colour is never the only signal.

## Components

- Collapsible left sidebar.
- Sticky header with environment status badges.
- Dense tables with inline status pills.
- Copyable SHA badges in `font-mono`.

## i18n

- English only in v1.
- All user-visible text lives in a string catalog file (for example `frontend/src/i18n/en.json`, or an equivalent). Strings are never hard-coded in components.
- Adding a language later is a translation task.
- OPEN: the exact catalog path is an example. Confirm the final path when the frontend is set up.
